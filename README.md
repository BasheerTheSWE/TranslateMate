- This iOS application allows users to translate text into different languages using :
	1. Voice input. 
	2. Manual text input. 

The app offers two main tabs: one for voice translation and another for manual text translation. It utilizes Core Data for storing translations, a translation rapid API for language translation, the Speech framework for voice input, AVFoundation for speech output, and UIKit for the user interface.



## Features

### Voice Translation
- Users can select a target language and use the record button to input text through voice.
- The application extracts text from the user's voice and sends it for translation using the translation API.
- The translated text is displayed to the user.

### Text Translation
